# What is Anarchy? Anarchy is a platform designed to bring together individuals who build and create with AI. 
We have observed a gap in the market - there is no clear all-in-one platform that provides the opportunity for creators to inspire and reward their community via the medium of building in public.
anarchy offers this space, combining community-driven innovation with blockchain technology to create a platform where AI creators can flourish. 

# How Does It Work?

As part of this Hackathon, the Anarchy team have focussed on migrating contracts from their current location on Moonbase Alpha and deployed directly to Asset Hub. We currently had functionality enabled for the creation and upload of designs, with social auth login enabled by ReOwn Wallet. For the purposes of this hackathon, we decided to focus on a feature of adding tips against comments (on top of just the initial NFT).
